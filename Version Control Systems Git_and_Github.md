# Git and GitHub Overview

## Git and GitHub Basics

| **Concept**               | **Description**                                                                                     |

| **Git**                   | Version control system to track changes to files. Free and open-source, available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. |
| **GitHub**                | Web-based hosting service for Git repositories. Popular for collaboration and code sharing.         |
| **Difference**            | **Git:** Software for version control on your computer. <br> **GitHub:** Online platform to store and share Git repositories. |
| **Version Control**       | Manages the history of code, tracking changes and enabling collaboration. Essential for software development. |
| **Analogy**               | Version control is like game checkpoints; move to any point in history and return to previous checkpoints. |
| **History**               | Before Git, SCCS (Source Code Control System) was used, proprietary and expensive. Git replaced SCCS, making version control accessible and user-friendly. |
| **Other VCS**             | Common version control systems include Subversion (SVN), CVS, and Perforce.                        |
